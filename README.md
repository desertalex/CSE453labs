Open up terminal (cmd)

Navigate to where you want the folder to go. A folder will be created when you run the next command so you dont need to create a folder now.

In the terminal type: git clone https://github.com/desertalex/CSE453labs.git

Press enter. A new folder should be added with the code for the project.

This will be organised with each directory having a weeks lab in it.

Put the code for the lab in the correct directory.
